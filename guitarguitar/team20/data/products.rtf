\\r\\n\
360\'b0 PROTECTION\
\
\\r\\n\
DROP-PROOF\
\
\\r\\n\
The patented Headlock\'ae design provides a level of protection worthy of the \\r\\nfinest instruments. Your guitar quickly straps in and remains stabilized during \\r\\ntransport. The headstock is suspended inside the case, saving the guitar from \\r\\nboth side and rear impacts that could otherwise snap the neck. Extensive testing \\r\\nreveals that \\"Hardcase protection\\" is a myth, as the Headlock\'ae - equipped M80 \\r\\noutperforms traditional wood and plastic hard cases in every way.\
\
\\r\\n\
IMPACT DEFLECTION & STRAP PIN PROTECTION\
\
\\r\\n\
Integral ABS panels deliver hardcase protection at a fraction of the weight \\r\\n(MONO cases weigh in at about 75% less than their hardcase counterparts.) The \\r\\nreinforced outer shell of the M80 hybrid case absorbs and deflects hard impact \\r\\naway from the vulnerable areas of the bass.\
\
\\r\\n\
Hi-density foam bumpers divert vertical impacts out and around the lower bout \\r\\nof the bass, away from the strap pin.\
\
\\r\\n\
SMART STORAGE\
\
\\r\\n\
Most MONO cases come equipped with the triple D-ring attachments required for \\r\\nthe optional Classic Tick Accessory Case, the modular tool case designed to \\r\\nextend the storage capacity of your guitar case. The Classic Tick Accessory Case \\r\\nseamlessly and securely attaches to the case as shown. Some older cases may not \\r\\nbe Tick-ready - please contact support if you have questions about the \\r\\nTick-compatibility of your MONO case.\
\
\\r\\n\
PLUG AND PLAY\
\
\\r\\n\
Everything in its place. Specialized storage compartments put your gear right \\r\\nwhere you need it.\
\
\\r\\n\
SECRET STASH\
\
\\r\\n\
The hidden upper pocket keeps your wallet, keys, and cell concealed. Pen \\r\\nslots double as tool storage. Business card storage and a durable key clip is \\r\\nalso included.\
\
\\r\\n\
BUILT TO LAST\
\
\\r\\n\
WEAR IT OUT\
\
\\r\\n\
We build our cases to military specs, using only high-test materials with \\r\\nextreme resistance to abrasion and the elements. Inside, the plush lining \\r\\nprotects delicate custom finishes. So rain or shine, your bass rides first class \\r\\nwhile you launch an urban assault. 100% animal free.\
\
\\r\\n\
RIVETED HANDLE\
\
\\r\\n\
Rock solid, industrial webbing handles come standard on MONO cases. Bar-tack \\r\\nstitching and steel rivets reinforce for strength, while high grade webbing \\r\\nprovides a super comfortable grip.\
\
\\r\\n\
HYPALON SOLE\
\
\\r\\n\
All M80 cases feature a hard-wearing sole and piping made of Hypalon - the \\r\\nsame industrial rubber used to create inflatable military rafts. This sole \\r\\nsimply does not wear out.\
\
\\r\\n\
DIMENSIONS & FITTING\

\
\\r\\n\
These measurements represent the inner capacity of the case. If you are \\r\\nunsure about the fit for your guitar, use this diagram as a guide and. This case \\r\\nis designed to fit standard body electric bass guitars including Fender, Ibanez, \\r\\nFodera, Warwick, Tobias, Yamaha and many others.

Fellow drummers, meet your new best friend. The Cymbal Case is equal parts \\r\\nperformance, protection, comfort and style. Your cymbals can make or break your \\r\\nsound, so take your sound with you to every gig.

RADIUS PIPING\

\\r\\n\
All our cases feature a hard-wearing sole and piping made of Hypalon - the \\r\\nsame industrial rubber used to create inflatable military rafts. This means the \\r\\nM80 cymbal pack won't wear through around the edges as most cymbal bags do.\
\
\\r\\n\
LUXURIOUS DIVIDERS\

A fully loaded cymbal case can get way too heavy. In the design process, we \\r\\ndiscovered that our backpack system with chest clip did wonders to distribute \\r\\nthe weight of all those cymbals. Unclip the shoulder strap to quickly stash them \\r\\nwhen you want them out of the way. Dedicated pockets for hi-hats (up to 15\\") and \\r\\nsplash cymbals (up to 10\\") keep those smaller cymbals safely separated.\

Hi-density foam bumpers within the case help to divert shocks out and around \\r\\nthe lower bout of the guitar, away from the strap pin.

A Superior Electronic Drumming Experience\
\
\\r\\n\
Drummers know that mesh drumheads offer the most natural feeling playing experience on\\r\\nan electronic kit. The Command Mesh Special Edition features large pads with tightly woven\\r\\nmesh drumheads for maximum playability. The 10\'94 snare and 8\'94 tom pads are all dual-zone,\\r\\nwhich means you get two different sounds per pad \'96 one sound on the mesh head and\\r\\nanother on the rim. You can use this to perform rim-shots or to program additional percussion\\r\\nsounds around the kit which can enhance your performances. The 8\'94 mesh kick drum pad is\\r\\nbuilt to last, with a large surface area that works great with the included kick pedal but also\\r\\neasily fits a double pedal if that\'92s your style. For cymbals there\'92s a 10\'94 crash with choke, a 10\'94\\r\\nride with choke, and a 10\'94 hi-hat that includes an expressive foot control pedal.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Command Advanced Drum Module\
\
\\r\\n\
The Command Advanced Drum Module has all the features a drummer needs to sound great,\\r\\nstarting with the sounds. There are 74 kits (54 factory + 20 user) and 671 sounds that span a\\r\\nvariety of genres and styles. Many of the sounds are also multi-sampled for more natural\\r\\nplayability. Instead of one sound that gets louder or softer depending on how hard you hit the\\r\\ndrum pad, you\'92ll hear slight variations in each hit, just like on an actual drum. This means that\\r\\nmore nuanced playing will shine through without the risk of sounding artificial and drum rolls\\r\\nwill sound natural.\

\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15 Drum Kits for Playing Any Style of Music\\r\\n\
An acoustic drum kit needs to be set up to play a specific style of music, so you\'92re stuck with one type of sound. But that\'92s not the case with the TD-1K\'97it includes 15 quality drum kits on board, so you can play any kind of music you want at the touch of a button, from rock and blues to jazz, world music, EDM, and beyond. At one practice session, you can rock hard with a heavy bottom-end sound, then instantly change kits to recreate the sound of your favourite band. Every kit reacts just like the acoustic and electronic kits they emulate, giving you a huge range of variety in one compact, standalone instrument.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelop Authentic Techniques with Responsive Pads and Cymbals\\r\\n\
Some drummers avoid electronic drums; worried they won\'92t play like their acoustic counterparts. There\'92s no need for concern with the Roland TD-1K\'97it fully supports essential acoustic playing techniques, which is especially important for beginners to learn to play correctly. Every drum sound offers a wide dynamic range and natural tone, and the pads provide a full range of natural expression. Unlike typical entry-level sets, the TD-1K\'92s cymbals include the advanced expressiveness found in all TD-series V-Drums modules, including bow and edge sounds and support for cymbal chokes. The hi-hat reacts to the nuances of your footwork, bringing personality and character to your playing. Great drumming is all about feel, and so is the TD-1K.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nStay Motivated with Onboard Training Functions That Make Learning Fun\\r\\n\
Built right into the TD-1K is a wealth of enjoyable functions to encourage learning, no matter whether you\'92re teaching yourself to play, studying regularly with an instructor, or simply want to keep your skills polished. Think of this kit as your own live-in drum teacher and personal backing band, packed with tutorial features that develop technique, boost motivation, and help you get the most out of practice time. Play along with the onboard metronome to tighten your timing, and use Coach mode to build and maintain speed, stamina, and accuracy. Get ready for your first band by jamming with the internal songs in the sound module, or connect a smartphone or music player via the Mix In jack and drum along with your favourite tunes. With the onboard recording function, you\'92ll get instant feedback of your progress as well as quickly capture and playback a new fill or creative groove.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nPractice at Home with Headphones and Ultra-Quiet, Beater-Free Kick Drum\\r\\n\
Traditional acoustic drums are extremely loud. Playing them at home is fun for you, but can be a problem for everyone else around! Quieter operation is a major benefit of electronic drums, and the Roland TD-1K is particularly quiet where it counts, thanks to the sound module\'92s headphone jack and the noise-reducing design of the snare, tom, and cymbal pads. While many electronic drum kits annoy the neighbours as the beater strikes the kick drum, the TD-1K reduces volume with a special beater-less pedal design. Optional NE-10 Noise Eater units can be used under the kick and hi-hat pedals to further reduce noise transfer to other rooms below. \\r\\n\
\
\\r\\nFits in Your Practice Space and Adjusts to Your Playing Style\\r\\n\
Inviting a supersize acoustic drum kit into your home is a big deal. Do you lose the spare room upstairs, or try and cram it into your living room? The space-saving TD-1K is a far more practical choice, fitting into the tightest living spaces with a stylish, modern look that lets life carry on around it. For added functionality, the sturdy, ergonomic drum rack is easily adjustable, allowing the drum positions to be set up for everyone from children to adults. In addition, the height of each cymbal and the angle of the snare pad can also be fine-tuned for your comfort and playing style. The TD-1K is perfect for students, but it\'92s also a great choice for an experienced drummer who needs a kit for home practicing or backstage warm-up.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nA Drum Set That Evolves with Your Playing\\r\\n\
As your playing takes off, you don\'92t want your drum kit to hold you back. The Roland TD-1K can grow with you, thanks to a range of optional extras. You can add an extra cymbal with the additional OP-TD1C Cymbal Pad, or swap out the standard kick pedal for the KT-10 or KD-9 models used in Roland\'92s more advanced V-Drums. With other accessories including the NE-10 Noise Eater, TDM-3 V-Drums Mat, and PM-03 Personal Drum Monitor, the TD-1K is an electronic kit that will go the distance.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nRecord on Your Computer Using One Standard USB Cable\
\\r\\n\
The TD-1K is not just fun to play by itself\'97it\'92s also a great way to make music with your computer. Included is a built-in USB-MIDI interface, making it simple to communicate with music software via just a USB cable, with no extra hardware needed. Maybe you\'92ll transfer your playing into your computer-based recording software, capturing a live drum feel in your latest masterpiece. Or perhaps you\'92ll use Roland\'92s free V-Drums Friend Jam series applications, which offer jam tracks, practice features, and the ability to compete with V-Drums users across the planet. For more in-depth education, the powerful DT-1 V-Drums Tutor provides a fun, dynamic platform for learning notation and essential drum techniques. Whatever application you chose, the TD-1K is a drum kit that lets you go places.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nSimple Operation Lets You Start Rocking in Minutes\
\\r\\n\
If you think that electronic drums are complicated, think again\'97using the TD-1K is as simple as it gets. With its clear layout, the control panel lets you access all functions quickly and easily, and you can see info at a glance with the LED display and the metronome\'92s flashing tempo indicator.\

Next generation analog for everyone\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro gives you the power to create nearly any analog synth sound you can imagine. With its unique dual-filter, 3-oscillator paraphonic design, 256 presets, 64-step sequencer, studio-grade effects, expanded connections and much more, UNO Synth Pro\\r\\nbreaks new ground for music makers.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Available in two form factors to suit all players\'92 needs\'97stage-ready with metal housing and premium Fatar semi-weighted keybed; or ultra-portable, USB-powered with capacitive keyboard\'97UNO Synth Pro offers everyone the next generation of analog sound design in a smart format that fits any space or budget.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\
3 Oscillators that do it all\
\
\\r\\n\
3 analog oscillators offer continuously variable waveshape, including pulse-width modulation. Oscillators can be hard-synced for more harmonically-complex tones, and oscillator FM (frequency modulation) lets you shape everything from bell-like sounds to screaming industrial tones.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro even includes ring modulation for wobbly, sci-fi sound, and a white noise generator for a wide range of percussive sounds and epic rises.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Recreate famous synth sound sources or forge entirely new ones - UNO Synth Pro\\r\\nhas the tools you need.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Dual filters with 24 available modes\
\
\\r\\n\
In addition to the original UNO Synth\'92s 2-pole OTA multimode filter, UNO Synth Pro adds a new 2/4-pole SSI LP filter with self-oscillation. The dual filters can be used in series or parallel, with invertible phase, for a total of 24 possible filter combinations.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
In short, the UNO Synth Pro can recreate the filter sound of the most famous classic synths as well as deliver fresh new options to the limits of your imagination.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Envelopes, filters and modulation matrix\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers 2 full ADSR envelopes, one dedicated to the filter and the other to amplitude, with both available as sources to modulate everything from oscillator pitch and waveshape to LFO speed or even other envelope stages.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
2 LFOs (low-frequency oscillators) can create classic synth vibrato, wah and tremolo as well as do more complex modulations including audio range FM.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
And a 16-slot modulation matrix makes routing all these a breeze. You can quickly and easily design even the most sophisticated modulation scheme, with both internal and external sources, including MIDI controllers.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Stunning onboard effects\
\
\\r\\n\
IK\'92s experience in modeling analog studio effects is decades long. For UNO Synth Pro, you\'92ll find a super warm and organic true-analog overdrive, plus 12 studio-quality effects in three simultaneous slots: modulation, delay and reverb. External signals can also be routed through these effects, with pre-effects filtering for maximum flexibility.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Improved playability\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers a premium 37-key semi-weighted keybed made by Italian manufacturer Fatar, while UNO Synth Pro Desktop provides an enhanced version of the original\'92s long-lasting capacitance-sensing keys along with pitch and mod strips for enhanced expression.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
You\'92ll find firm-touch rubber pads for the control sections, plus LED-backlit indicators and an LED display for key information, making it easier than ever to use UNO Synth Pro live on stage or in deep programming sessions in the studio.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Presets, sequencer and arpeggiator\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers 256 user-editable presets, each capturing the full state of the sound engine from oscillators to effects.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
An onboard 64-step sequencer offers both step and real-time recording, with automation for up to 40 parameters, letting you create incredibly intricate and evolving soundscapes. You can even write CV and gate automation.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
And a 10-mode arpeggiator makes it easy to create intricate patterns and runs plus a new \'93chord mode\'94 that takes advantage of UNO Synth Pro\'92s paraphonic design.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Advanced connectivity\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers two noiseless, balanced stereo outputs as well as headphone out, for superior audio quality in any situation.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
USB and 5-pin DIN MIDI In and Out make it easy to integrate with other synths, Mac/PC and mobile devices, and its assignable CV/Gate connections lets UNO Synth Pro interact effortlessly with your Eurorack or other modular system.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
And now, audio input allows access to the filter and FX section for external signals, in addition to the original thru-put for daisy-chaining multiple units together without using a mixer.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Advanced software control for Mac/PC\

Next generation analog for everyone\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro gives you the power to create nearly any analog synth sound you can imagine. With its unique dual-filter, 3-oscillator paraphonic design, 256 presets, 64-step sequencer, studio-grade effects, expanded connections and much more, UNO Synth Pro\\r\\nbreaks new ground for music makers.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Available in two form factors to suit all players\'92 needs\'97stage-ready with metal housing and premium Fatar semi-weighted keybed; or ultra-portable, USB-powered with capacitive keyboard\'97UNO Synth Pro offers everyone the next generation of analog sound design in a smart format that fits any space or budget.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\
3 Oscillators that do it all\
\
\\r\\n\
3 analog oscillators offer continuously variable waveshape, including pulse-width modulation. Oscillators can be hard-synced for more harmonically-complex tones, and oscillator FM (frequency modulation) lets you shape everything from bell-like sounds to screaming industrial tones.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro even includes ring modulation for wobbly, sci-fi sound, and a white noise generator for a wide range of percussive sounds and epic rises.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Recreate famous synth sound sources or forge entirely new ones - UNO Synth Pro\\r\\nhas the tools you need.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Dual filters with 24 available modes\
\
\\r\\n\
In addition to the original UNO Synth\'92s 2-pole OTA multimode filter, UNO Synth Pro adds a new 2/4-pole SSI LP filter with self-oscillation. The dual filters can be used in series or parallel, with invertible phase, for a total of 24 possible filter combinations.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
In short, the UNO Synth Pro can recreate the filter sound of the most famous classic synths as well as deliver fresh new options to the limits of your imagination.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Envelopes, filters and modulation matrix\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers 2 full ADSR envelopes, one dedicated to the filter and the other to amplitude, with both available as sources to modulate everything from oscillator pitch and waveshape to LFO speed or even other envelope stages.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
2 LFOs (low-frequency oscillators) can create classic synth vibrato, wah and tremolo as well as do more complex modulations including audio range FM.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
And a 16-slot modulation matrix makes routing all these a breeze. You can quickly and easily design even the most sophisticated modulation scheme, with both internal and external sources, including MIDI controllers.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Stunning onboard effects\
\
\\r\\n\
IK\'92s experience in modeling analog studio effects is decades long. For UNO Synth Pro, you\'92ll find a super warm and organic true-analog overdrive, plus 12 studio-quality effects in three simultaneous slots: modulation, delay and reverb. External signals can also be routed through these effects, with pre-effects filtering for maximum flexibility.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Improved playability\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers a premium 37-key semi-weighted keybed made by Italian manufacturer Fatar, while UNO Synth Pro Desktop provides an enhanced version of the original\'92s long-lasting capacitance-sensing keys along with pitch and mod strips for enhanced expression.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
You\'92ll find firm-touch rubber pads for the control sections, plus LED-backlit indicators and an LED display for key information, making it easier than ever to use UNO Synth Pro live on stage or in deep programming sessions in the studio.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Presets, sequencer and arpeggiator\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers 256 user-editable presets, each capturing the full state of the sound engine from oscillators to effects.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
An onboard 64-step sequencer offers both step and real-time recording, with automation for up to 40 parameters, letting you create incredibly intricate and evolving soundscapes. You can even write CV and gate automation.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
And a 10-mode arpeggiator makes it easy to create intricate patterns and runs plus a new \'93chord mode\'94 that takes advantage of UNO Synth Pro\'92s paraphonic design.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Advanced connectivity\
\
\\r\\n\
UNO Synth Pro offers two noiseless, balanced stereo outputs as well as headphone out, for superior audio quality in any situation.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
USB and 5-pin DIN MIDI In and Out make it easy to integrate with other synths, Mac/PC and mobile devices, and its assignable CV/Gate connections lets UNO Synth Pro interact effortlessly with your Eurorack or other modular system.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
And now, audio input allows access to the filter and FX section for external signals, in addition to the original thru-put for daisy-chaining multiple units together without using a mixer.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Advanced software control for Mac/PC\

MiniNova is a compact, super-cool performance synth with the same sound engine as its big brother: the UltraNova. It comes with 256 incredible onboard sounds which you can tweak with 5 knobs, or totally warp with 8 'animate' buttons. MiniNova also has an onboard VocalTune effect as well as a classic vocoder so you can recreate iconic vocal sounds from Hip Hop, Urban and electronic music.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
What is MiniNova?\
\
\\r\\n\
MiniNova is a powerful mini-keys synth with incredible performance controls which enable you to tweak and warp the onboard sounds, and your own voice. It has the same synth-engine as its big brother - the UltraNova - and comes with 256 awesome sounds so you can get started straight away. If you want to dig deeper, it's got a fully editable Nova-class synth engine (derived from the legendary Supernova series in the 1990s).\
\
\\r\\n\
Is MiniNova for you?\
\
\\r\\n\
MiniNova's compact size, massive sound and performance/editing controls make it perfect for producers, gigging musicians and anyone creating music with computers - it can also be a 37 key controller keyboard with MIDI I/O. The VocalTune and vocoder enable you to recreate classic vocal effects, as well as brand new voice-bending possibilities!\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Choose your sound\
\
\\r\\n\
MiniNova has 256 onboard sounds and space to save another 128 of your own sounds. You can quickly search for sounds by selecting the type of music you're making, or the type of sound you're after whether it's bass, lead - hip hop or techno. MiniNova comes with a free software Patch Librarian so you can store as many sounds as you want on your computer. If 256 is not enough, there are numerous soundpacks for MiniNova assembled by renowned artists and sound designers. These can be downloaded free from: novationmusic.com/soundpacks\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Tweak, warp and arpeggiate your sound\
\
\\r\\n\
MiniNova can do things other synths can't. It has knobs which allow you to tweak and edit the sounds, but it can also 'animate' sound with 8 back-lit buttons. These trigger 'mods' in the synth engine that can warp sound in incredible ways as you play. There is also a large knob for filter cutoff so you can get instant control of the filter whatever else you are doing. MiniNova has an arpeggiator; you can use the 8 buttons to jam with arpeggios creating totally new sequences in realtime.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Classic & brand-new vocal effects\
\
\\r\\n\
MiniNova takes vocal effects one step further. As well as a vocoder, it has VocalTune. This means you can talk into the mic and play the tune you want your voice to follow on the keyboard recreating those classic Hip Hop / Urban vocal effects. You can also run your voice through MiniNova's effects engine, adding reverb, distortion, chorus/phase, gator compression or EQ. This doesn't need to be limited to your voice; there is an input which you can plug a guitar or any other instrument and give it the same treatment; effects or vocoder.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The synth engine & effects\
\
\\r\\n\
MiniNova has an enormously powerful synth engine, unheard of in such a compact synth. There are 14 conventional waveforms to choose from (square, sine, sawtooth, pulse, triangle and combinations), 36 wavetables and 20 digital waveforms. Each of the 3 oscillators (per voice) have density/detune for fattening up sounds, virtual sync and 'hardness' - which acts as an additional lowpass filter. There are 14 filter types (and you can run 2 simultaneously), 6 envelope generators, 3 LFOs and 20 modulation slots where you can link modules of the synth engine together to shape sound. MiniNova can add up to 5 effects to each voice including distortion, reverb, chorus/phase, delay, compressor, EQ and Novation's unique gator effect.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Editing software included\
\
\\r\\n\
Editing sounds in such a powerful synth can be overwhelming, so we've created a software application gives you visual access to the synth engine. The MiniNova Editor works as a plug-in within your DAW or music software. You can fully edit MiniNova using the hardware, the software just makes it more simple to see what you are doing.\

Stage presence is everything, and you work hard to develop your image as a solo performer or band. The AX-Edge is designed to not only look stunning on stage, but also to match your own unique style. It\'92s available in black or white, and each color has individual design elements that make it stand out, like the \'93none-more-black\'94 keys and removable Edge Blades. The AX-Edge comes with an extra Edge Blade in the box (a silver Edge Blade for the black model and a gold Edge Blade for the white) and you can even create your own original designs. Create a look that complements your band\'92s style or swap out Edge Blades to keep things fresh.\

\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Stage-Ready Classics to Custom-Made Tones\\r\\n\
We didn\'92t cram generic preset sounds into the AX-Edge\'97it has a curated sound set driven by our latest technology. The onboard sounds are optimized for stage performance to produce sounds that cut through, even in a loud band. Dedicated buttons for favorite sounds give you instant access to edgy leads, big fat basses, and all manner of keyboard sounds perfect for the performing keytarist, whether it\'92s taking a solo or sharing the limelight with your bandmates. If you like to customize your sounds, you can connect to the AX-Edge editor app with Bluetooth MIDI and tweak your sounds wirelessly. Splits and layers let you take full advantage of the expansive, full-sized keyboard. And a wealth of stunning new effects, including a master compressor and EQ, give you polished, studio-quality tone in any venue. And thanks to the Tone Remain function, you can switch sounds seamlessly on stage without notes or effect tails being cut off prematurely.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nTake Control of Your Performance\'97with Both Hands\\r\\n\
Unlike keyboardists who perform behind a traditional keyboard rig, keytar players know the thrill of tearing it up right in front of their adoring fans. And when your moment comes, the AX-Edge gives you the hands-on control to nail your performance, giving it subtle nuance or over-the-top intensity. The AX-Edge\'92s neck controls, refined over years of development and artist feedback, are highly intuitive and truly take your performance to another level. While your right hand will appreciate the supremely playable keyboard, your left hand will love the modulation bar, pressure sensitive pitch ribbon, and easy-to-reach controls for portamento, hold, octave switch, and program change. If desired, many controls can be reassigned to functions that perfectly suit your performance style.\
\
\\r\\nThe Stage-Ready, Performance-Focused Powerhouse\\r\\n\
As a gigging keyboard player, a lot can fall on your shoulders. You cover lots of different sounds and parts, often acting as the backbone of a performance and filling in any gaps. With this reality in mind, the AX-Edge has thoughtful performance features that aid you in the heat of battle. An innovative dual display system keeps you in command at all times, while the onboard arpeggiator and song player can handle backing duties while you concentrate on slaying your audience. And the built-in vocoder, which can be layered with internal sounds, is just the thing for unique backing vocals or funky, retro lead parts.\

The VR-730 is equipped with a 73-note waterfall keyboard with semi-weighted action, ideal for playing traditional organ techniques like trill, sputter, glissando, and percussive hits. As soon as you put your hands on the keys, you\'92ll feel right at home with the smooth touch that has just the right amount of resistance. And with the quick-firing response, it\'92s easy and comfortable to play fast passages, percussive attack expressions, and soft glissandos. The waterfall shape also provides a friendly feel for piano players, and the extra octave is a welcome addition for those used to 61-note keyboards, offering extended playing range and bigger zones for splits.\
\
Gig-Ready and Easy to Carry\
\
\\r\\n\
Vintage gear is great, but it\'92s not very practical for the average working keyboard player who needs to travel light. A combo organ, rotary speaker, and electric piano can add up to several hundred pounds, and are very bulky and difficult for one person to move. The VR-730 includes all these sounds and more in an instrument that weighs just 21 lbs. 14 oz./9.9 kg, so it\'92s a breeze to transport and even easier to set up. And with support for battery operation, the VR-730 delivers the ultimate mobile convenience for street gigs, weddings, and various on-the-go events.\
\
\\r\\n\
Hassle-Free Operation for Expressive Freedom On Stage\
\
\\r\\n\
The VR-730 was designed from the ground up with the needs of live players in mind. Its smart, nicely organized front-panel layout features a clear LCD screen and dedicated organ, piano, and synth sound sections. This gives you direct access to all the essential sounds you need, plus lots of real-time controls for expressive tone manipulation. Seven simultaneous effects include rotary, delay, reverb, tone, overdrive, compressor, and MFX, and the dedicated knobs tweak multiple parameters for powerful sound shaping with minimal effort. It\'92s also simple to set up splits and layers on the fly, and to save all your settings in user memory locations for instant recall on stage.\
\
\\r\\n\
Authentic Combo Organs with Virtual Tone Wheel Tech\
\
\\r\\n\
With the VR-730, you\'92re able to deliver authentic organ performances with all the tonal characteristics of revered vintage combo organs. Roland\'92s latest Virtual Tone Wheel Organ engine faithfully emulates the sound-generating process of a real tone wheel organ in every way, while nine harmonic bars provide classic hands-on tone control. Rotary effects are vital to the combo organ sound, and the VR-730\'92s three genre-oriented types make it simple to call up the right rotary tone for any style, from gospel and pop to jazz and rock. You can also deepen the sound further with the Twin Rotary effect, add some grit with tube-style overdrive, or call up the ring modulator for a more aggressive sound.\
\
Anchor Your Music with Essential Electric and Acoustic Pianos\
\
\\r\\n\
Piano is a cornerstone sound for live playing, and the VR-730 provides a wide selection for covering all musical styles. Many historic electric piano are on board, including a favorite from the RD-2000. You can also spice up your EPs with vintage effects like phaser, tremolo, touch wah, and tape delay. The gorgeous acoustic grand piano features 88-note stereo multi-sampling, delivering pro-level tone that rivals Roland\'92s dedicated stage pianos. The VR-730\'92s easy-access compressor effect works great with the piano sounds, ensuring that your playing always cuts through when performing with loud bands and big ensembles.\
\
\\r\\n\
SuperNATURAL Synth Sounds from Vintage to Modern\
\
\\r\\n\
The VR-730 is packed with a ton of ready-to-play synths, from Roland analog classics like JUNO strings and JUPITER pads to textured, modern-era digital tones and beyond. There are lots of fat, analog-style lead and bass tones to choose from as well, plus organic \'9180s-era synth sounds from Roland\'92s famous D-50. The 200-plus sounds cover a wide range of styles and genres, and are organized into dedicated one-touch categories like Lead, Bass, Pad, Strings, and more for fast access.\
\
\\r\\n\
Classic Combo Design, Ready for the Stage\
\
\\r\\n\
The VR-730 offers a classic streamlined appearance with real wood side panels, delivering the authentic vibe of a vintage combo organ. The control panel\'92s matte finish hides fingerprints for a clean and tidy look, and also eliminates harsh reflections from stage lighting that can reduce visibility.\
\
Expand Your Sound Collection with Free Downloads from Roland\'92s Axial Sound Library Site\
\
\\r\\n\
Roland\'92s Axial site is the official tone library home for downloading new sounds for Roland keyboards. Specially designed by top programmers, \'93The Cover Band Collection\'94 for the VR-730 provides dozens of patches inspired by popular songs, giving you lots of ready-to-play sounds for all types of gigs. Be sure to check Axial often, as we\'92re always adding new sounds for the VR-730 and other Roland instruments.\
\
Dedicated iPad Editor for Organs and Synths\
\
\\r\\n\
The free VR-09 Editor app for iPad gives you powerful, intuitive control of the VR-730\'92s organ and synth sound engines via your tablet\'92s full-color touchscreen interface. Quickly edit organ sounds and customize vintage tone wheel characteristics such as leakage, click noise, and rotary speed, and easily access synth sounds to build custom tones and layers. After tweaking sounds at home, you can take your iPad to the gig and use the app for extra real-time control on stage. Cable-free communication between the VR-730 and iPad is simple to set up with Roland Wireless Connect. Alternately, you can link up with a standard USB cable using the appropriate adapter for your specific iPad model.\

\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
A new mobile instrument generation\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\nIt started as a sketch of a young Yamaha design team: Under the concept name \'93reimagined interfaces of classic Yamaha keyboards\'94 the group presented a series of four compact instruments, in which every single one celebrates the personality of a legendary Yamaha instrument \'96 but with a character of its own reimagined for today\'92s \'91on-the-go life style\'92. The concept also integrates a web-based sound exchange between musicians and allows a cooperative sound design. With the introduction of reface, this vision becomes reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Inspiration guaranteed\
\
\\r\\n\
At home, in a studio, in a park or on a train \'96 the compact design and the powerful integrated stereo speakers allow inspiration in seconds \'96 without any equipment to set up. Creativity can be realised anywhere: Thanks to the battery power, all reface Mobile Mini Keyboards are ready at any time \'96 even when there is no power socket nearby. The setup is done in seconds, even the connection to notebook, iPhone or iPad for the recording and saving of sounds.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
It\'92s (not) a toy!\
\
\\r\\n\
All four reface models are presenting themselves as a creative toy for sound design. But despite their compact design, they are professional instruments that are inviting to play. All models feature Yamaha\'92s brand new \'91HQ\'92 Mini-Action keyboard with 37 keys (3 octaves). The user interfaces were designed separately for each instrument introducing features such as drawbars for the reface YC organ and the capacitive Multi-Touch surface on the reface DX.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
reface CS: analogue Synthesizer\
\
\\r\\n\
With the legendary Yamaha Control Synthesizer series, introduced in 1976, music history was written by artists like Vangelis, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. In keeping with tradition the reface CS unites simple handling and creative sounds with a massive dynamic. But the concept was not to clone a monophonic synthesizer: The polyphonic tone generator with 8 voices and 5 oscillator types (multi saw, pulse, oscillator sync, ring modulation, frequency modulation) offers a rich bandwidth of exciting sounds from analogue to digital. All parameters are changeable intuitively using sliders.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Discover and share sounds online\
\
\\r\\n\
All four reface models offer a rich potential for creative sound design \'96 and the opportunity to get in touch with the whole world: With Soundmondo, Yamaha created an online hub connecting the reface community all over the globe. Soundmondo offers creative possibilities to create, share and discover sounds. The connection is established intuitively using a special Web MIDI technology for Google Chrome. As soon as a reface model is plugged in, it offers the possibility of direct synchronisation. Voices and set lists can be stored in a private area as well as shared with the community.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
reface iOS App for iPhone and iPad\
\
\\r\\n\
Quick and easy storage as well as management of sounds with iPhone and iPad: The free reface iOS app for Apple mobile devices makes data transfer extremely simple. A name, a picture and multiple tags can be applied to stored voices; they can be sorted in different ways as well. Search functionality is also included. Using a set list, voices can be arranged in a specific order and recalled one after the other. Another impressive feature is the possibility to exchange voices using QR codes: A distinctive code can be generated from any stored voice and can then be shared using the different options available with iOS. It can for example be sent via email or read using the camera of another iPad to import it into the app.\

\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The term \'93solid top\'94 of course refers to the soundboard of an acoustic guitar being made of solid wood, rather than being laminated. However, just because the top is solid, it does not necessarily mean the sound automatically benefits from this feature. The tone of the instrument only improves significantly when the whole guitar is built correctly to optimize the energy a solid soundboard can generate. Artist Series is built to do exactly this.\

\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
FST2 is a forward shifted X brace design, this means the axis of the X is closer to the sound hole and therefore creates a larger soundboard area allowing for more energy and vibration to be harnessed. Both the X braces and asymmetric tone bars are carefully scalloped. The scalloping design was the result of years of continual development in our Yairi workshops.\

After 50 years of making guitars, continual improvement through the use of \\r\\nemerging technologies, processes, and materials is still at the heart of our \\r\\nculture. Alvarez guitars are constructed correctly in every sense from raw \\r\\nmaterial preparation to construction and manufacturing processes. Their tone \\r\\nwoods are carefully cured; our components such as neck blocks and wood joints \\r\\nare carefully designed. The painting, sanding and polishing techniques we use \\r\\nare continually researched and developed, and our tone is impeccably crafted and \\r\\nmarried to a stable, designed and lively soundbox.\
\
\\r\\n\
The term \'93solid top\'94 of course refers to the soundboard of an acoustic guitar \\r\\nbeing made of solid wood, rather than being laminated. However, just because the \\r\\ntop is solid, it does not necessarily mean the sound automatically benefits from \\r\\nthis feature. The tone of the instrument only improves significantly when the \\r\\nwhole guitar is built correctly to optimize the energy a solid soundboard can \\r\\ngenerate. Artist Series is built to do exactly this.\
\
\\r\\n\
Each model is designed to get the best out of its components, and for them to \\r\\nwork together to produce balance, lively projection and great response. These \\r\\ncomponents include a bracing architecture that is specifically designed for each \\r\\nbody shape or tonal requirement. Their Bi-level bridge is designed to heighten \\r\\nstring tension and improve sustain and response. Real bone nut and saddle, \\r\\npremium tonewoods and our crafted attenuated finish all further the quality of \\r\\nconstruction and positively impact the performance of the instrument.\
\
\\r\\n\
This caring approach to development comes from one simple goal: To deliver \\r\\nthe best guitars in the market at every price point, instruments that are truly \\r\\namazing value and offer a fantastic player experience.\

Faith HiGloss series have always been designed to offer both visual and aural beauty, and with the updating to HiGloss-3, we\'92re sure you\'92ll agree these wonderful instruments will continue to inspire musicians for generations to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\

Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure that these incredibly popular models are available longer-term and yet retain all the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series afficianados have come to expect. Using high grade Englemann Spruce for the top and highly-figured, 3-piece Rosewood bound in Flamed Maple for the back and sides, HiGloss-3 models also feature solid Flamed Maple binding on the front and use stripy Indonesian Ebony for the fingerboard, bridge, headplate and heelcap.\

Tonally, this combination of wood is generally bright and \'91zingy\'92, delivering great clarity. Visualising this as a frequency curve, it would be shaped like a smile: high on the bass, dipping down through the middle and rising once again at the top end. Therefore greater string separation and articulation is achieved, lending itself to fingerstyle and solo pieces in particular.\

Finlayson guitars is a new and exciting range of superb acoustic guitars, designed in collaboration with esteemed luthier Billy Finlayson and industry titan Robert Godin of Godin guitars.\
\
\\n\
Part of the reason that Finlayson guitars sound so good is the use of Adirondack Spruce for the inner bracing. Bracing forms and shapes much of the guitar\'92s voice & projection so using Adirondack Spruce, which is the strongest and lightest species of Spruce, is a massively important part of the process.\
\
\\n\
Something of an all-rounder, the J50ME is particularly happy when strummed: the body size puts out a lot of focused low end with balanced mids and a sweet top end. This is definitely a guitar for singer songwriters who want to fill up lots of space with sound but leave enough space in the middle for a voice. The sound is rich, percussive and inspiring.\

The AEG, a compact body electric acoustic guitar with a slim neck has been \\r\\nwell-accepted for its easy playability for more than two decades. Ibanez is \\r\\nproud to announce that the AEG series has been renewed with updated electronics \\r\\nand looks. The changes were based on the concept, \'93simple and easy control.\'94\
\
\\r\\n\
The AEG50 starts with a new preamp, an Ibanez AEQ-TTS. The small and simple \\r\\npreamp has only two control knobs, volume and shape. This at-a-glance tone \\r\\ncontrol offers natural acoustic sound in the center position. It allows players \\r\\nto adjust the tone easily and enables them to go from low, fat and powerful \\r\\ntones to a bright and crispy sound while adjusting only one knob. A new \\r\\neasy-to-read onboard tuner with LCD(liquid crystal display) is located on the \\r\\npreamp.\
\
\\r\\n\
The AEG50 comes with a simplified rosette, a binding and ornamentation on the \\r\\nheadstock. These finer details add a sharp and stylish atomosphere to the \\r\\nguitar.\
\
\\r\\n\
Other features include a Spruce top and a Sapele back & sides body, an Ibanez \\r\\nT-bar II Undersaddle pickup which equalizes the volume from each string and \\r\\ndelivers a well-balanced signal, and special bulb-shaped Ibanez Advantage Bridge \\r\\npins for easy string installation.\

Standard X-M Bracing\
\
\\r\\n\
Spending a few years with trial and error, Ibanez finally reached to out-of-the-box X-M Bracing to generate the ultimate sound standing out on the stage. The carefully designed scalloped X-bracing, the allocation of tone braces and finger braces transmit the string vibration efficiently through the bridge to the body. The X-M Bracing creates the clear bottom and crispy treble sound with trimmed warm mid-range, yet providing wide dynamic range and highly response.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
AE body shape\
\
\\r\\n\
Designed for projection, balance, and comfort, the AE's perfectly crafted contemporary body shape offers the best of all worlds.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Ibanez AP11 Magnetic Pickup\
\
\\r\\n\
The newly designed AP11 pickup is small, lightweight, and positioned so it won\'92t inhibit the natural vibrations of the top wood. The pickup generates a highly responsive sound with minimal feedback and delivers a lively response throughout the entire frequency range. The sound is transparent and reflects the guitar\'92s natural acoustic tone while preserving presence and mid-range. The AP11 also works well with effects such as reverb, chorus, and many others.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Ibanez Custom Electronics w/ Volume and Tone Control\
\
\\r\\n\
The guitar also features on-board treble and bass controls for contouring the tone, making the AE suitable for variety of applications for modern players.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Scalloped Bridge\
\
\\r\\n\
The light-weight Scalloped Bridge helps improving the vibration efficiency of the top board for better resonance, as well as giving more flexible string action adjustment.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Comfort Grip w/Rounded Fingerboard Edge\
\
\\r\\n\
In order to achieve supreme playability, the neck was specially designed with Thin-C shape style comfort grip with fingerboard's rounded edge.\

The new PA acoustic series from Ibanez aims to bring a new level of fine-tuned\\r\\nplayability and tone to modern fingerstyle players. This line features a uniquely\\r\\nshaped asymmetrical jumbo body with slightly more surface area on the upper\\r\\nside of the body. This shape generates a rich low end, and offers easier access\\r\\non the treble side for tapping, making this an optimal design for incorporating\\r\\npercussive elements. The bridge, and body cutaway are also specially shaped\\r\\nmaking them better suited as tapping surfaces so that multiple sounds and\\r\\ndynamic variations can be incorporated into the percussive playing elements.\\r\\nThe PA series also utilizes a multiple pickup system featuring a contact pickup\\r\\nand stereo outputs. This electronics package creates an incredible array of\\r\\nsounds and the pickups are positioned in prime locations to capture the\\r\\nmultifaceted nuances of fingerstyle playing.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Ibanez AP11 Magnetic / Contact pickups\
\
\\r\\n\
The AP11 pickup is small, lightweight and positioned so it won\'92t inhibit the \\r\\nnatural vibrations of the top wood. The pickup generates a highly responsive \\r\\nsound with minimal feedback throughout the entire frequency range. The sound \\r\\nis transparent and reflects the guitar\'92s natural acoustic tone while \\r\\npreserving presence and mid-range. The AP11 also works well with effects such \\r\\nas reverb, chorus and many others. The Contact pickup consists of three \\r\\ntransducers facilitating organic individual note clarity and naturally \\r\\nreproduces percussive body tapping techniques. This pickup also adds an airy \\r\\ndepth of tone and brightness to the amplified sound.\
\
\\r\\n\
Ibanez Custom Electronics w/ Magnetic Pickup Volume and Contact \\r\\nPickup Volume\
\
\\r\\n\
Blending the Contact pickup with the Magnetic pickup provides more natural \\r\\nacoustic tone. This pickup combination enhances the depth of the sound and \\r\\nthe tonal brightness. It especially excels for solo fingerstyle players or in a \\r\\nsmall acoustic ensemble.\
\
\\r\\n\
Dual Outputs (Magnetic/Contact pickup outputs)\
\
\\r\\n\
Plugged into the endpin jack only: Magnetic pickup + Contact pickup with \\r\\nmixed output Plugged into both the endpin jack and the open jack: Endpin Jack \\r\\n= Magnetic pickup, Open Jack = Contact Pickup\
\
\\r\\n\
Macassar Ebony top loading bridge\
\
\\r\\n\
For a better percussive sound, the Macassar Ebony bridge features a top \\r\\nloading system without a bridgepin. It also offers a fast and easy method for \\r\\nstring changes.\
\
\\r\\n\
Asymmetric jumbo body\
\
\\r\\n\
Developed for modern fingerstyle players, the asymmetric jumbo body \\r\\nfeatures a low-end focused sound and tapping friendly shape\
\
\\r\\n\
Modified X-M Bracing\
\
\\r\\n\
With several years spent on research and development, Ibanez ultimately \\r\\ndeveloped the exciting, new X-M bracing design. The carefully designed \\r\\nscalloped X-bracing, features strategically positioned tone and finger braces, \\r\\nwhich transmit string vibration more efficiently through the bridge to the \\r\\nbody, greatly enhancing the quality and projection of the sound. This modified \\r\\nX-M Bracing design creates a highly responsive sound with a wide dynamic \\r\\nrange, but it also emphasizes a focused low-end, which perfectly complements \\r\\nmodern fingerstyle playing.\
\
\\r\\n\
25 3/4 inch scale\
\
\\r\\n\
A 25 3/4 inch scale helps to maintain proper tension and pitch even while \\r\\ndown tuning, a technique modern finger players often utilize. This scale-length \\r\\nalso delivers improved sustain.\

\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The FlyNeck\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The neck with parametric design. Give you an extraordinary playing experience. The idea behind FlyNeck was to design and build the most comfortable intuitive guitar neck possible. The structural geometry of the FlyNeck was achieved by tracking the different forces on the neck during the shifting of positions whilst playing the LAVA ME 2. We carefully designed the neck profile, adding or removing materials as necessary to ensure the FlyNeck would fit your individual playing style without you even noticing it.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The most advanced fret machining system, easy and comfortable to press.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The Plek PRO machine is the most advanced guitar fret machining system on the planet. Designed to ensure the best string action available, this state of the art process removes any potential intonation issues and allows the LAVA ME 2 to have an advanced level of playability and sound quality straight out of the box. After simultaneously scanning the surface of the fretboard whilst simulating the strings tension, it then cuts the frets with an accuracy of 0.01mm. Plek Pro's high accuracy cutting assists the LAVA ME 2 in achieving it's exceptional tone and comfortable playing position.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
300% Stiffer. Always works for you.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
LAVA MUSIC re-designed the neck structure of the LAVA ME 2 and reinforced it with 2 Ultra Stiff carbon fiber rods. This FlyNeck is 300% stiffer that the previous generation as a result, giving longer lasting durability and enhancing the overall playing experience.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
The world\'92s leading unibody guitar. The revolutionary one-piece injection moulded technology.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
LAVA MUSIC invented the first one-piece injection moulded LAVA ME guitar in 2017, revolutionising the design, materials used and manufacturing process of the modern guitar. This technology allows us to not only make the shape more comfortable to hold but also significantly reduce the use of glue, whilst retaining excellent levels of acoustic performance.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Works in all Conditions\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Unlike wood, which tends to warp in changing weather conditions, the Super AirSonic carbon fiber body material of the LAVA ME 2, can adapt to changes in temperature from -20\uc0\u8451  to 90\u8451  and humidity of 10% - 90%. Whether you\'92re in a desert or polar region, the LAVA ME 2 will always work for you.\

The PRS SE P50E is a parlor-sized acoustic with a big voice. Featuring a solid spruce top and figured maple back and sides, the PRS SE P50E brings a sophisticated new aesthetic to the popular parlor platform. This body size offers bold projection with more focused tone, and the maple back and sides provide unexpected warmth and tonal transparency. When matched with PRS hybrid \'93X\'94/Classical bracing, which allows the top to freely vibrate and project, the SE P50E has an uncommon 3-dimensional character for a maple back and side guitar. The Tonare Parlor body shape and shorter (24.72\'94) scale length make this guitar comfortable to play for hours on end.\

In the late 1960s the situation for US guitar manufacturers became difficult: guitars that were made in Japan, looking very similar to US guitars, were flooding the market but at a much lower price. These guitars increasingly endangered the US manufacturers dominance on the market, and a few American companies reacted to that development in an appropriate manner: They did not take any legal steps but instead launched a counter offensive. That\'92s when \'93Sigma Guitars\'94 was born. In 1970 \'93SIGMA\'94, the brandname for acoustic guitars, was launched. They were built by specially trained staff in the most efficient guitar factories in Japan and then sent to the US for inspection before being released for sale and shipping to the music stores.\

\\r\\n\\r\\n\
\'93Sigma Guitars\'94 were soon to have an excellent, yes even legendary, reputation. Some models were said to be of outstanding quality, both, in construction and sound. That\'92s why it is striking, but not surprising, that there are hardly any second-hand Sigma guitars up for sale. Most owners still swear by their instruments and would never part with them. There are Sigma fans, Sigma communities, Sigma websites; and even collectors have specialized in Sigma guitars.\

Parlour guitars, with their diminutive physical dimensions and vintage styling always stand out on a retailers wall, but in reality, this was the original acoustic body shape for scores of years, Dreadnought and Folk and other variants didn\'92t appear until many years after the Parlour, so they are not quite as rare as we often think.\

\\r\\n\
To compliment the heritage of the parlour shape, we marry a Canadian Spruce top, with Indonesian Mahogany, ensuring we have a great tone, then we brace the top as we would a folk model, so that we get a tremendous sound projection.\

This model has an onboard Tanglewood EX4 EQ system, with 4 band graphic, so it can be used live or in the studio, and if you zoom in on the picture you will note the lovely hand inlaid genuine timber rosette which we think finishes the instrument off perfectly.\

Two new walnut-top models join our inviting and budget-friendly Academy Series: the Dreadnought\\r\\nAcademy 20e and Grand Concert Academy 22e. As a top wood, walnut\'92s density and hardness are\\r\\ncomparable to mahogany and Hawaiian koa, producing a natural compression effect that levels out the\\r\\nguitar\'92s attack for a more balanced response. Both models feature layered walnut back and sides.\
\
\\r\\n\
The Dreadnought Academy 20e will serve up the robust tone players love from the classic\\r\\nbody shape, making it a great choice for strummers. Expect clear lows, crisp highs and plenty of\\r\\nmidrange power, with room-filling projection. The compact Grand Concert Academy 22e features\\r\\naccommodating contours for a more intimate feel. You\'92ll hear clear definition between notes, making\\r\\nit a great choice for fingerstyle players or those who employ flatpicked lead lines. Despite its smaller\\r\\nbody, it serves up plenty of volume and dynamic range.\
\
\\r\\n\
With a built-in walnut armrest \'97 a feature typically reserved for high-end guitars \'97 these models level\\r\\nup the playing comfort, and their slender necks, along with a 24-7/8-inch scale length, make it easy\\r\\nto navigate the ebony fretboard. Like other Academy Series models, these feature a slightly shallower\\r\\nbody depth than our standard Dreadnought and Grand Concert models, making them easier to hold\\r\\nand play. Thin matte finish showcases walnut\'92s natural color and grain for an earthy aesthetic. Both\\r\\nmodels include our performance-friendly ES-B pickup and preamp, featuring a built-in tuner and\\r\\n3-band EQ control, and come with a Taylor gig bag.\

Who would have thought, from their conception during the mid 1920\'92s, \\r\\nresonator guitars would remain immune to fashion and musical trends, and still \\r\\nbe as popular today than ever before.\
\
\\r\\n\
The Vintage AMG1 acoustic resonator guitar is constructed from the finest \\r\\nmaterials, to create both cosmetically and audibly, accurate representations of \\r\\nthese unique guitars. With a beautifully chromed steel body, the AMG1 delivers \\r\\nthat unmistakable warm metallic, sustaining resonator tone from a single, 9 \'bd\'94 \\r\\ncone, spun from high grade aluminium.\
\
\\r\\n\
The first resonator guitars were created in the days before amplification, so \\r\\nacoustic guitars could compete with other instruments, horns and percussion \\r\\ninstruments in dance orchestras for example. The Vintage AMG1 maintains \\r\\ntradition with a loud voice and projection ideally suited to country, blues, \\r\\nbluegrass, Hawaiian finger picking and slide styles with rich, full chords and \\r\\nsoaring lead notes.\
\
\\r\\n\
Like all high quality resonator guitars, the \'91biscuit\'92 bridge is constructed \\r\\nfrom top grade maple, whilst a precision cut nut offers comfortable string \\r\\nspacing over the fingerboard, with the round Eastern mahogany neck joining the \\r\\nbody at the 14th fret, in traditional \'91reso\'92 style.\
\
\\r\\n\
With an enclosed headstock design and matching chrome covered machine heads, \\r\\ndiamond pattern speaker cover plate, period style tailpiece and f-hole body \\r\\ndesigns, the Vintage AMG1 chrome resonator is indeed, a shining example of the \\r\\nVintage design team\'92s relentless quest for innovation, authentic tone and \\r\\noutstanding playability.

Actuator\
An actuator is installed on the inner surface of the guitar back vibrates in response to the vibrations of the strings. The vibrations of the actuator are then conveyed to the body of the guitar and to the air in and around the guitar body, generating authentic reverb and chorus sounds from inside the body.\
\
\\r\\n\
Simple Controls\
Three simple knobs let you adjust the degree of effect applied and the line-out volume level. Additionally, keeping the controls small minimizes the area of the holes in the body material, reducing acoustic sound loss\
\
\\r\\n\
New Battery Box\
The battery box is integrated into the end-pin jack. This requires fewer holes in the body, thus reducing acoustic sound loss. Connect the cable from the jack to a PA or amp to use as an Electro-Acoustic Guitar.\
\
\\r\\n\
Designed to Provide Superb Acoustic Guitar Sound\
The body is an all-solid guitar based on the L-series. A modified non-scalloped bracing design enhances the low end with retaining the bright tone. Treating the tops with Yamaha\'92s exclusive A.R.E. process gives the instrument a rich, vintage quality tone.\

The new FG800 models have been developed based on Yamahas extensive research as \\r\\nwell as feedback from players and industry experts. We found that lots of things \\r\\ndidn\'92t need to be touched - but there was a consistent theme: guitarists wanted \\r\\nto go back towards the original FG180 sound with just a little more volume; a \\r\\nlittle more bass; a little more oomph.\
\
\\r\\n\
Combining their luthiers' experience with state of the art structural acoustic \\r\\nanalysis, we developed an even deeper understanding of how internal structure \\r\\naffects a guitar's voice, and how the original FG180 sounded so incredible. From \\r\\nthere, they engineered a new design which both captures and enhances that classic \\r\\ntone.\
\
\\r\\n\
One result of this unique approach is a totally new scalloped bracing \\r\\npattern. It gives the FG800 Series more volume, more projection, more low end \\r\\nand a bigger tone for the player. In addition, the \\r\\nnew bracing pattern moves the resonant centre much closer to the middle of the \\r\\nguitar, with a big impact on both the tone and the feel to the player.\
\
\\r\\n\
But Yamahas goal was not only to craft a guitar that sounds great today, but to \\r\\ncraft one who's tone lasts for a lifetime. A solid top board, a 0.25mm thin \\r\\nfinish for great tone and superior wood protection, a super-comfortable thin \\r\\nneck profile and thin back and sides construction ensure maximum volume and \\r\\nresonance with long-term stability and consistency.\

\
\\r\\n\
This gorgeous electro-acoustic travel guitar is fitted with a Fishman\'ae \\r\\nSonitone preamp with volume and tone controls, easy battery access and \'bc\'94 jack \\r\\nand USB outputs.\

Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure \\r\\nthat these incredibly popular models are available longer-term and yet retain \\r\\nall the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series afficianados have come to \\r\\nexpect.

Tonally, this combination of wood is generally bright and \'91zingy\'92, delivering \\r\\ngreat clarity. Visualising this as a frequency curve, it would be shaped like a \\r\\nsmile: high on the bass, dipping down through the middle and rising once again \\r\\nat the top end. Therefore greater string separation and articulation is \\r\\nachieved, lending itself to fingerstyle and solo pieces in particular.\

The Venus is the now iconic shape that brought Faith Guitars to the \\r\\nconsciousness of so many players over the years. The combination of a 15\\" lower \\r\\nbout and a slimmer depth of body looks to classic OM or Auditorium body-shapes \\r\\nfor inspiration, and makes the Venus the perfect compromise.\

In the late 1960s the situation for US guitar manufacturers became difficult: guitars that were made in Japan, looking very similar to US guitars, were flooding the market but at a much lower price. These guitars increasingly endangered the US manufacturers dominance on the market, and a few American companies reacted to that development in an appropriate manner: They did not take any legal steps but instead launched a counter offensive. That\'92s when \'93Sigma Guitars\'94 was born. In 1970 \'93SIGMA\'94, the brand name for acoustic guitars, was launched. They were built by specially trained staff in the most efficient guitar factories in Japan and then sent to the US for inspection before being released for sale and shipping to the music stores.\

\'93Sigma Guitars\'94 were soon to have an excellent, yes even legendary, reputation. Some models were said to be of outstanding quality, both, in construction and sound. That\'92s why it is striking, but not surprising, that there are hardly any second-hand Sigma guitars up for sale. Most owners still swear by their instruments and would never part with them. There are Sigma fans, Sigma communities, Sigma websites; and even collectors have specialized in Sigma guitars.\

This acoustic/electric nylon-string Grand Concert from our Academy Series may be the best nylon-string guitar you\'92ll find for the money. The underlying design goal of the series is to make the acoustic guitar accessible to more players by bringing Taylor\'92s legendary playability and tone into an affordable price range. One of the benefits of a nylon-string guitar is that the light string tension is easy on the fingertips. Another inviting feature is a built-in armrest to enhance the playing comfort. Tonally, the wood pairing of layered sapele back and sides with a solid Lutz spruce top, together with the body\'92s internal bracing, project a warm, mellow nylon voice with crisp percussive appeal that suits a variety of musical styles and responds well to both fingerpicking and flatpicking.\

\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Actuator\
\
\\r\\n\
An actuator installed on the inner surface of the guitar back vibrates in response to the vibrations of the strings. The vibrations of the actuator are then conveyed to the body of the guitar, and to the air in and around the guitar body, generating authentic reverb and chorus sounds from inside the body.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Simple Controls\
\
\\r\\n\
Three simple knobs let you adjust the degree of effect applied and the lineout volume level. Additionally, keeping the controls small minimizes the area of the holes in the body material, reducing acoustic sound loss.\

Newly Designed Battery Box\
\
\\r\\n\
Battery box integrated into the end-pin jack. This requires fewer holes in the body, thus reducing acoustic sound loss. Connect the cable from the jack to a PA or amp to use as an acoustic electric guitar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\

Top Materials\
\
\\r\\n\
All models in the GC series feature solid tops and backs that provide the characteristically rich tone of superior materials.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Wood Selections\
\
\\r\\n\
Wood is \'93alive\'94 and must be prepared carefully over a long period of time in order to be suitable for use in an acoustic guitar. Even then, no two pieces of wood are the same. It takes a tremendous amount of skill and experience to be able to select the right woods and combinations of woods for an instrument that will bear the Yamaha name.\\r\\n\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Neck Shaping\
\
\\r\\n\
Necks on the Grand Concert series are shaved one by one by a luthier using his sensitive hands to feel the curvature of the neck, making it fit perfectly for smoother finger movement and solid stability.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Bracing Pattern\
\
\\r\\n\
The bracing pattern, an essential element that defines the guitars tonal character and response, was devised by Antonio de Torres in the 1880s. In the new GC series, Yamaha has improved upon this shape and design delivering greater volume and response, bright and clear high-end, and rich bass.\
\
\\r\\n\\r\\n\
Saddle Fit & bridge\
\
\\r\\n\
The saddle captures string vibration transferring it through the bridge and on to the top. The relationship of these three components; saddle, bridge, and top, is extremely important on a guitar. Using their advanced skills, our craftsmen fit the saddle into a groove in the bridge with a high level of surface to surface contact. The bridge is also precisely positioned and glued into on the top with a high level of accuracy.\

MiniNova is a compact, super-cool performance synth with the same sound engine as its big brother: the UltraNova. It comes with 256 incredible onboard sounds which you can tweak with 5 knobs, or totally warp with 8 'animate' buttons. MiniNova also has an onboard VocalTune effect as well as a classic vocoder so you can recreate iconic vocal sounds from Hip Hop, Urban and electronic music.

\r\n\r\n
What is MiniNova?
\r\n
MiniNova is a powerful mini-keys synth with incredible performance controls which enable you to tweak and warp the onboard sounds, and your own voice. It has the same synth-engine as its big brother - the UltraNova - and comes with 256 awesome sounds so you can get started straight away. If you want to dig deeper, it's got a fully editable Nova-class synth engine (derived from the legendary Supernova series in the 1990s).

\r\n
Is MiniNova for you?
\r\n
MiniNova's compact size, massive sound and performance/editing controls make it perfect for producers, gigging musicians and anyone creating music with computers - it can also be a 37 key controller keyboard with MIDI I/O. The VocalTune and vocoder enable you to recreate classic vocal effects, as well as brand new voice-bending possibilities!

\r\n\r\n
Choose your sound
\r\n
MiniNova has 256 onboard sounds and space to save another 128 of your own sounds. You can quickly search for sounds by selecting the type of music you're making, or the type of sound you're after whether it's bass, lead - hip hop or techno. MiniNova comes with a free software Patch Librarian so you can store as many sounds as you want on your computer. If 256 is not enough, there are numerous soundpacks for MiniNova assembled by renowned artists and sound designers. These can be downloaded free from: novationmusic.com/soundpacks

\r\n\r\n
Tweak, warp and arpeggiate your sound
\r\n
MiniNova can do things other synths can't. It has knobs which allow you to tweak and edit the sounds, but it can also 'animate' sound with 8 back-lit buttons. These trigger 'mods' in the synth engine that can warp sound in incredible ways as you play. There is also a large knob for filter cutoff so you can get instant control of the filter whatever else you are doing. MiniNova has an arpeggiator; you can use the 8 buttons to jam with arpeggios creating totally new sequences in realtime.

\r\n\r\n
Classic & brand-new vocal effects
\r\n
MiniNova takes vocal effects one step further. As well as a vocoder, it has VocalTune. This means you can talk into the mic and play the tune you want your voice to follow on the keyboard recreating those classic Hip Hop / Urban vocal effects. You can also run your voice through MiniNova's effects engine, adding reverb, distortion, chorus/phase, gator compression or EQ. This doesn't need to be limited to your voice; there is an input which you can plug a guitar or any other instrument and give it the same treatment; effects or vocoder.

\r\n\r\n
The synth engine & effects
\r\n
MiniNova has an enormously powerful synth engine, unheard of in such a compact synth. There are 14 conventional waveforms to choose from (square, sine, sawtooth, pulse, triangle and combinations), 36 wavetables and 20 digital waveforms. Each of the 3 oscillators (per voice) have density/detune for fattening up sounds, virtual sync and 'hardness' - which acts as an additional lowpass filter. There are 14 filter types (and you can run 2 simultaneously), 6 envelope generators, 3 LFOs and 20 modulation slots where you can link modules of the synth engine together to shape sound. MiniNova can add up to 5 effects to each voice including distortion, reverb, chorus/phase, delay, compressor, EQ and Novation's unique gator effect.

\r\n\r\n
Editing software included
\r\n
Editing sounds in such a powerful synth can be overwhelming, so we've created a software application gives you visual access to the synth engine. The MiniNova Editor works as a plug-in within your DAW or music software. You can fully edit MiniNova using the hardware, the software just makes it more simple to see what you are doing.

Drawing upon the vast knowledge, know-how and techniques of Yamaha's master craftsmen, has been developed the Concert series; to deliver the best tone and performance from a classical guitar. With slightly thinner back and sides and Yamaha's trade mark thin finish these instruments delivers better sound response.

\r\n\r\n
New bracing pattern, thinner bridge plate
\r\n
The new CG series features a new bracing pattern that delivers excellent response and rich resonance. These guitars also feature a bridge plate that efficiently transfers string vibration to the guitar top.

\r\n\r\n
Cedar Top
\r\n
Bright, warm tone. Excellent response with relatively thick treble. Cedar offers a mature tone with little change over time, providing a high level of perfection.

\r\n\r\n
Stable Neck Condition
\r\n
Necks utilize a strong 3-ply laminate design that resists warping and twisting. This design improves neck strength, offers greater stability against shape changes over time, and allows lower string height. In addition to providing greater neck stability, the laminated design also makes effective use of resources.

\r\n\r\n
The matte finish on the back of the neck allows the left hand to move smoothly while also providing a secure grip. The finish is applied with a thin coat that contributes to improved resonance. The same matte finish is applied to the bridge for improved resonance.

\r\n\r\n
Saddle Fit
\r\n
Years of experience and original technologies have brought improvements to our saddle and saddle slot design. Crafting these components with great precision provides a highly accurate fit that improves attack and sustain while reducing string vibration loss to transfer rich resonance to the body.

BLUE LAVA

Optimizing material use and production techniques remains our key focus throughout. We replaced wood with recyclable HPL to reduce deforestation and manufactured our products through automatic production lines to prevent industrial waste. This makes
BLUE LAVA friendly to the environment while maintaining high performance.

\r\n
HPL adapts to changes in temperature from -4? to 122? and humidity from 10% to 90%. It is lightweight, sturdy, weatherproof, and easy to maintain.

The Venus Blue Moon is a truly individual instrument. One of the beauties of \r\ngenuinely solid, natural tonewoods is that each piece of solid timber used will \r\nvary in its natural colouration and its particular grain patterns. So your Blue \r\nMoon will be as unique as you and your music.

\r\n
Tonally, Mango has an interesting character. It is not as loud and punchy as \r\nrosewood nor as straightforwardly mellow as mahogany, yet it bears its own \r\ndistinctive warmth. With frequency prominence starting a little below that of \r\nmahogany and dropping off a little earlier in the mid-range, the overall tone \r\ncould be described as dark and moody. Much like maple guitars, the reduced level \r\nof resonant overtones makes the Mango-bodied Blue Moon a perfect stage guitar: \r\nEminently controllable, balanced and resistant to feedback.

\r\n
Mango trees grow freely right across the Indonesian archipelago, so the \r\ntimbers used on Blue Moon guitars are sourced close to our workshops in Java, \r\nIndonesia, and as always, from certified timber merchants.

\r\n
Finished with flamed Maple binding, Macassan Ebony fittings, Fishman \r\nElectronics and complete in a hard case, your Faith Venus Blue Moon is sure to \r\nintrigue and delight you at every turn.

\r\n
The Venus is the now iconic shape that brought Faith Guitars to the \r\nconsciousness of so many players over the years. The combination of a 15\" lower \r\nbout and a slimmer depth of body looks to classic OM or Auditorium body-shapes \r\nfor inspiration, and makes the Venus the perfect compromise. In fact, the Naked \r\nVenus was voted 'The UK's Best Acoustic Guitar' at the MIA Music Awards in \r\n2013.

\r\n
It is still big enough to deliver a big acoustic performance, yet remains \r\nsmall enough for the player to jump around on stage with no problem.

Faith Neptune Acoustic Guitars are based upon Patrick James Eggle's highly \r\nacclaimed 'Saluda' shape. In its basic form, the Neptune is 16\" across the lower \r\nbout, which qualifies it as a baby-jumbo. In practise, this makes the Neptune a \r\nJumbo bodied guitar for every occasion. Whereas the full jumbo sized Jupiter is \r\nall-out big, the Neptune balances size, sonic projection and comfort perfectly.

\r\n
Acoustically, the Neptune will deliver rich and deep bass notes with ease, \r\nyet never become 'boom-ey' or over-powering. Plus when it's strapped around your \r\nneck for hours at a rehearsal or gig, it sits comfortably without weighing you \r\ndown too much.

Big guitars deserve big protection, and that's why this iconic MONO® case is \r\ndesigned with signature features recognized by musicians all over the world. An \r\nabsolute must-have for guitarists who own one (or several) jumbo acoustic \r\nguitars, this case is comfortable from the get-go and ready for anything life \r\nbrings.

\r\n
360° PROTECTION

\r\n
The patented Headlock® design keeps your guitar headstock securely suspended \r\nwithin the case, stabilizing it during transport and protecting it from side and \r\nrear impacts that could otherwise snap the neck.

\r\n
Hi-density foam bumpers within the case help to divert shocks out and around \r\nthe lower bout of the guitar, away from the strap pin. Integral ABS panels \r\ndeliver hardcase protection at a fraction of the weight, and the case's \r\nreinforced outer shell absorbs and deflects bumps away from vulnerable areas of \r\nthe guitar.

\r\n
BUILT TO LAST

\r\n
Like all other MONO® cases, this one is built to military specs, using \r\nhigh-test and 100% animal free materials with extreme resistance to the elements \r\nand all touring conditions. Water-resistant Sharkskin shell keeps you on the \r\nmove come rain or shine, while the plush inner lining protects delicate guitar \r\nfinishes and keeps your prized musical instrument looking pristine.

\r\n
Rock-solid, industrial webbing handles come standard on MONO® cases. Bar-tack \r\nstitching and steel rivets provide strength reinforcement, while high grade \r\nwebbing offers a super comfortable grip at all times. Ergonomic backpack straps \r\nand mesh padding give perfect support for your back, and YKK zippers bring extra \r\nreliability for the long haul.

\r\n
A hard-wearing sole and piping made of Hypalon — the same industrial rubber \r\nused to create inflatable military rafts — means this sole simply doesn't wear \r\nout.

\r\n
SMART INTEGRATED STORAGE

\r\n
Specialized storage compartments put your gear right where you need it, while \r\nthe hidden upper pocket keeps your wallet, keys and smartphone concealed.

\r\n
This case comes equipped with triple D-ring attachments, making it 100% \r\ncompatible with The Tick® 2.0, our modular accessory case that attaches \r\nseamlessly to the case and extends storage capacity like no other.

\r\n
FITS LIKE A GLOVE

That’s when “Sigma Guitars” was born. In 1970 “SIGMA”, the brandname for acoustic guitars, was launched. They were built by specially trained staff in the most efficient guitar factories in Japan and then sent to the US for inspection before being released for sale and shipping to the music stores.

\r\n\r\n
“Sigma Guitars” were soon to have an excellent, yes even legendary, reputation. Some models were said to be of outstanding quality, both, in construction and sound. That’s why it is striking, but not surprising, that there are hardly any second-hand Sigma guitars up for sale. Most owners still swear by their instruments and would never part with them. There are Sigma fans, Sigma communities, Sigma websites; and even collectors have specialized in Sigma guitars.

Faith HiGloss series have always been designed to offer both visual and aural beauty, and with the updating to HiGloss-3, we’re sure you’ll agree these wonderful instruments will continue to inspire musicians for generations to come.\r\n\r\n

Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure that these incredibly popular models are available longer-term and yet retain all the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series afficianados have come to expect. Using high grade Englemann Spruce for the top and highly-figured, 3-piece Rosewood bound in Flamed Maple for the back and sides, HiGloss-3 models also feature solid Flamed Maple binding on the front and use stripy Indonesian Ebony for the fingerboard, bridge, headplate and heelcap.

\r\n\r\n
Tonally, this combination of wood is generally bright and ‘zingy’, delivering great clarity. Visualising this as a frequency curve, it would be shaped like a smile: high on the bass, dipping down through the middle and rising once again at the top end. Therefore greater string separation and articulation is achieved, lending itself to fingerstyle and solo pieces in particular.

\r\n\r\n
This Faith Guitar is fitted with the refined, low-profile Fishman INK3 preamp system with the Sonicore piezo pickup located under the saddle. The preamp features a chromatic tuner, 3 band EQ and volume control. The output jack is located at the base of the guitar as part of the ingenious, easy-access battery compartment. All HiGloss series Faith Guitars are complete with a Faith Hardcase.

\r\n\r\n
The Venus is the now iconic shape that brought Faith Guitars to the consciousness of so many players over the years. The combination of a 15\" lower bout and a slimmer depth of body looks to classic OM or Auditorium body-shapes for inspiration, and makes the Venus the perfect compromise. In fact, the Naked Venus was voted 'The UK's Best Acoustic Guitar' at the MIA Music Awards in 2013.

\r\n\r\n
It is still big enough to deliver a big acoustic performance, yet remains small enough for the player to jump around on stage with no problem.

The new CG series features a new bracing pattern that delivers excellent response and rich resonance. These guitars also feature a bridge plate that efficiently transfers string vibration to the guitar top.

Spruce Top
\r\n
Clear fundamental tone. Massive tone with great variation according to touch. Tone improves as the wood matures.

\r\n\r\n
Stable Neck Condition
\r\n
Necks utilize a strong 3-ply laminate design that resists warping and twisting. This design improves neck strength, offers greater stability against shape changes over time, and allows lower string height. In addition to providing greater neck stability, the laminated design also makes effective use of resources.

\r\n\r\n
The matte finish on the back of the neck allows the left hand to move smoothly while also providing a secure grip. The finish is applied with a thin coat that contributes to improved resonance. The same matte finish is applied to the bridge for improved resonance.

In the late 1960s the situation for US guitar manufacturers became difficult: guitars that were made in Japan, looking very similar to US guitars, were flooding the market but at a much lower price. These guitars increasingly endangered the US manufacturers dominance on the market, and a few American companies reacted to that development in an appropriate manner: They did not take any legal steps but instead launched a counter offensive. That’s when “Sigma Guitars” was born. In 1970 “SIGMA”, the brand name for acoustic guitars, was launched. They were built by specially trained staff in the most efficient guitar factories in Japan and then sent to the US for inspection before being released for sale and shipping to the music stores.

\r\n\r\n
“Sigma Guitars” were soon to have an excellent, yes even legendary, reputation. Some models were said to be of outstanding quality, both, in construction and sound. That’s why it is striking, but not surprising, that there are hardly any second-hand Sigma guitars up for sale. Most owners still swear by their instruments and would never part with them.

Players love the great looks of the Eastern mahogany body, the warm, mid-range focused output and dynamic delivery of this superb tonewood. Solid spruce is the choice for the soundboard, perfect for its light sonic characteristics, delivering a bright clear tone, ideal for big chord projection, solo note runs and intricate fingerpicking.

The aesthetics and features of the Vintage V300 Acoustic Folk Guitar, immediately conjure up an image of models costing three times as much, with a palm-friendly Eastern mahogany neck, super smooth, bound fingerboard with dot inlays, multi-ply body bindings, Eastern mahogany bridge, decorative soundhole rosette and smooth-geared machine heads.

In the late 1960s the situation for US guitar manufacturers became difficult: guitars that were made in Japan, looking very similar to US guitars, were flooding the market but at a much lower price. These guitars increasingly endangered the US manufacturers dominance on the market, and a few American companies reacted to that development in an appropriate manner: They did not take any legal steps but instead launched a counter offensive. That’s when “Sigma Guitars” was born. In 1970 “SIGMA”, the brand name for acoustic guitars, was launched. They were built by specially trained staff in the most efficient guitar factories in Japan and then sent to the US for inspection before being released for sale and shipping to the music stores.

\r\n\r\n
“Sigma Guitars” were soon to have an excellent, yes even legendary, reputation. Some models were said to be of outstanding quality, both, in construction and sound. That’s why it is striking, but not surprising, that there are hardly any second-hand Sigma guitars up for sale. Most owners still swear by their instruments and would never part with them. There are Sigma fans, Sigma communities, Sigma websites; and even collectors have specialized in Sigma guitars.

\r\n
\r\n Top-Quality Pianos, Organs, and More
\r\n Acoustic pianos, electric pianos, and organs are bread and butter for most performing keyboardists. In the JUNO-DS88, the pianos have been newly enhanced with improved sound and response, and there are even more organs to choose from. In addition to this new DS Tone Bank, the instrument includes the entire 1000-plus sound set from the previous-generation JUNO-Di, and patches from that keyboard are fully compatible with the JUNO-DS88.

\r\n
\r\n Weighted Keys for an Authentic Piano Feel
\r\n The JUNO-DS88 features 88 weighted-action keys, a first in the long history of the JUNO series. Roland’s Ivory Feel-G Keyboard with progressive hammer action is an ideal complement to the expressive new piano sounds, providing high-end touch and playability while still keeping the instrument light and mobile. This makes the JUNO-DS88 an obvious choice for pro players, as well as piano students looking for a portable, versatile instrument to learn on.

\r\n

\r\n One thing that’s made the JUNO series a players’ favorite is its instant-access design, which makes it easy to call up fantastic sounds right away. But if you like to dig in and customize, the JUNO-DS88 now offers even more adjustable parameters than before, allowing you to tweak patches and performances with detailed precision. The front panel provides an expanded array of hands-on knobs and sliders for creating patches and adjusting sounds as you perform, while the rear panel features jacks for connecting hold and expression pedals at the same time.

\r\n
\r\n Wave Expansion Slot for Adding New Sounds
\r\n To complement its impressive onboard sound set, the JUNO-DS88 supports internal waveform expansion via USB for unlimited tonal range. Over 1000 EXP sounds are available for free download at Roland’s Axial website, including top-quality acoustic piano collections, world instruments, go-to studio standards, percussion, loops, and more. If don’t find what you need there, it’s even possible to load in WAV files from your personal library and play them from the keyboard! Out of the box, the JUNO-DS88 comes with the versatile EXP-06 Studio Collection preloaded in the wave expansion slot.

\r\n
\r\n Phrase Pads for Triggering Songs and Samples
\r\n With the JUNO-DS88’s eight Phrase Pads, you can supplement your keyboard performances with samples or music files stored on USB memory. Just load up the pads with whatever you like—one-shot samples, vocals, sound effects, loops, or complete music tracks—and trigger them with a quick touch when needed.

\r\n
\r\n Mic Input with Vocoder and Auto Pitch
\r\n If you’re a solo performer or singer/songwriter, you’ll love the JUNO-DS88’s mic input, which lets you get great vocal sounds without having to carry around extra gear. There’s a dedicated vocal reverb, plus Auto Pitch for singing with the “stepped” electronic vocal effect popular in today’s music. The built-in vocoder is big fun too, allowing you to sing into a mic and control the tone and pitch via sounds played on the keyboard.

\r\n
\r\n Eight-Track Pattern Sequencer
\r\n When you have an idea for a song or beat, you can easily capture and develop it with the onboard pattern sequencer. The intuitive, non-stop operation won’t interrupt your creative flow, letting you build up full arrangements with multiple sounds in no time. The sequencer is also perfect for enhancing live performances with pre-made backing music and on-the-fly looping.

\r\n
\r\n Music Production Partner
\r\n The JUNO-DS88 is not only great on stage—it works great for computer music production as well. The integrated USB interface provides a solid front end for a mobile or studio recording setup, allowing you to record MIDI and audio data, including sounds from the mic input. There’s even a dedicated DAW Control mode for controlling your music software from the JUNO-DS88’s front panel.

Next generation analog for everyone
\r\n
UNO Synth Pro gives you the power to create nearly any analog synth sound you can imagine. With its unique dual-filter, 3-oscillator paraphonic design, 256 presets, 64-step sequencer, studio-grade effects, expanded connections and much more, UNO Synth Pro\r\nbreaks new ground for music makers.

\r\n\r\n
Available in two form factors to suit all players’ needs—stage-ready with metal housing and premium Fatar semi-weighted keybed; or ultra-portable, USB-powered with capacitive keyboard—UNO Synth Pro offers everyone the next generation of analog sound design in a smart format that fits any space or budget.

\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
3 Oscillators that do it all
\r\n
3 analog oscillators offer continuously variable waveshape, including pulse-width modulation. Oscillators can be hard-synced for more harmonically-complex tones, and oscillator FM (frequency modulation) lets you shape everything from bell-like sounds to screaming industrial tones.

\r\n\r\n
UNO Synth Pro even includes ring modulation for wobbly, sci-fi sound, and a white noise generator for a wide range of percussive sounds and epic rises.

\r\n\r\n
Recreate famous synth sound sources or forge entirely new ones - UNO Synth Pro\r\nhas the tools you need.

\r\n\r\n\r\n
Dual filters with 24 available modes
\r\n
In addition to the original UNO Synth’s 2-pole OTA multimode filter, UNO Synth Pro adds a new 2/4-pole SSI LP filter with self-oscillation. The dual filters can be used in series or parallel, with invertible phase, for a total of 24 possible filter combinations.

\r\n\r\n
In short, the UNO Synth Pro can recreate the filter sound of the most famous classic synths as well as deliver fresh new options to the limits of your imagination.

\r\n\r\n
Envelopes, filters and modulation matrix
\r\n
UNO Synth Pro offers 2 full ADSR envelopes, one dedicated to the filter and the other to amplitude, with both available as sources to modulate everything from oscillator pitch and waveshape to LFO speed or even other envelope stages.

\r\n\r\n
2 LFOs (low-frequency oscillators) can create classic synth vibrato, wah and tremolo as well as do more complex modulations including audio range FM.

\r\n\r\n
And a 16-slot modulation matrix makes routing all these a breeze. You can quickly and easily design even the most sophisticated modulation scheme, with both internal and external sources, including MIDI controllers.

\r\n\r\n
Stunning onboard effects
\r\n
IK’s experience in modeling analog studio effects is decades long. For UNO Synth Pro, you’ll find a super warm and organic true-analog overdrive, plus 12 studio-quality effects in three simultaneous slots: modulation, delay and reverb. External signals can also be routed through these effects, with pre-effects filtering for maximum flexibility.

\r\n\r\n
Improved playability
\r\n
UNO Synth Pro offers a premium 37-key semi-weighted keybed made by Italian manufacturer Fatar, while UNO Synth Pro Desktop provides an enhanced version of the original’s long-lasting capacitance-sensing keys along with pitch and mod strips for enhanced expression.

\r\n\r\n
You’ll find firm-touch rubber pads for the control sections, plus LED-backlit indicators and an LED display for key information, making it easier than ever to use UNO Synth Pro live on stage or in deep programming sessions in the studio.

\r\n\r\n
Presets, sequencer and arpeggiator
\r\n
UNO Synth Pro offers 256 user-editable presets, each capturing the full state of the sound engine from oscillators to effects.

\r\n\r\n
An onboard 64-step sequencer offers both step and real-time recording, with automation for up to 40 parameters, letting you create incredibly intricate and evolving soundscapes. You can even write CV and gate automation.

\r\n\r\n
And a 10-mode arpeggiator makes it easy to create intricate patterns and runs plus a new “chord mode” that takes advantage of UNO Synth Pro’s paraphonic design.

\r\n\r\n\r\n
Advanced connectivity
\r\n
UNO Synth Pro offers two noiseless, balanced stereo outputs as well as headphone out, for superior audio quality in any situation.

\r\n\r\n
USB and 5-pin DIN MIDI In and Out make it easy to integrate with other synths, Mac/PC and mobile devices, and its assignable CV/Gate connections lets UNO Synth Pro interact effortlessly with your Eurorack or other modular system.

\r\n\r\n
And now, audio input allows access to the filter and FX section for external signals, in addition to the original thru-put for daisy-chaining multiple units together without using a mixer.

\r\n\r\n

Who would have thought, from their conception during the mid 1920’s, \r\nresonator guitars would remain immune to fashion and musical trends, and still \r\nbe as popular today than ever before.

\r\n
The Vintage AMG1 acoustic resonator guitar is constructed from the finest \r\nmaterials, to create both cosmetically and audibly, accurate representations of \r\nthese unique guitars. With a beautifully chromed steel body, the AMG1 delivers \r\nthat unmistakable warm metallic, sustaining resonator tone from a single, 9 ½” \r\ncone, spun from high grade aluminium.

\r\n
The first resonator guitars were created in the days before amplification, so \r\nacoustic guitars could compete with other instruments, horns and percussion \r\ninstruments in dance orchestras for example. The Vintage AMG1 maintains \r\ntradition with a loud voice and projection ideally suited to country, blues, \r\nbluegrass, Hawaiian finger picking and slide styles with rich, full chords and \r\nsoaring lead notes.

\r\n
Like all high quality resonator guitars, the ‘biscuit’ bridge is constructed \r\nfrom top grade maple, whilst a precision cut nut offers comfortable string \r\nspacing over the fingerboard, with the round Eastern mahogany neck joining the \r\nbody at the 14th fret, in traditional ‘reso’ style.

\r\n
With an enclosed headstock design and matching chrome covered machine heads, \r\ndiamond pattern speaker cover plate, period style tailpiece and f-hole body \r\ndesigns, the Vintage AMG1 chrome resonator is indeed, a shining example of the \r\nVintage design team’s relentless quest for innovation, authentic tone and \r\noutstanding playability. Play on.

The new FG800 models have been developed based on Yamahas extensive research as \r\nwell as feedback from players and industry experts. We found that lots of things \r\ndidn’t need to be touched - but there was a consistent theme: guitarists wanted \r\nto go back towards the original FG180 sound with just a little more volume; a \r\nlittle more bass; a little more oomph.

\r\n
Combining their luthiers' experience with state of the art structural acoustic \r\nanalysis, we developed an even deeper understanding of how internal structure \r\naffects a guitar's voice, and how the original FG180 sounded so incredible. From \r\nthere, they engineered a new design which both captures and enhances that classic \r\ntone.

\r\n
One result of this unique approach is a totally new scalloped bracing \r\npattern. It gives the FG800 Series more volume, more projection, more low end \r\nand a bigger tone for the player. In addition, the \r\nnew bracing pattern moves the resonant centre much closer to the middle of the \r\nguitar, with a big impact on both the tone and the feel to the player.

\r\n
But Yamahas goal was not only to craft a guitar that sounds great today, but to \r\ncraft one who's tone lasts for a lifetime. A solid top board, a 0.25mm thin \r\nfinish for great tone and superior wood protection, a super-comfortable thin \r\nneck profile and thin back and sides construction ensure maximum volume and \r\nresonance with long-term stability and consistency.

Crafted with either a solid Sitka spruce or genuine Mahogany top inlaid into a fully chambered Mahogany body, Highway Series guitars are engineered with a proprietary internal architecture including a tapered floating X bracing pattern and inventive thinline design, producing remarkable resonance and dynamic, organic tone. With fidelity and performance at its core, the Fishman Fluence Acoustic Pickup system incorporates an elegantly curved magnetic Fluence Core pickup with innovative all-analog technology to deliver pure and truly musical amplified tone with astonishing sonic realism, clarity and feedback resistance.

There’s an aura of 1930's blues about the Vintage Statesboro' Whisky Sour Series of acoustic and electro-acoustic guitars, designed by English guitarist and blues historian Paul Brett.

\n
These cool acoustic and electro-acoustic guitars, not only have that authentic ‘feel it in your bones’ innate blues emotion, there’s also a modern approach within playability and sound that amateur and professional players will appreciate.

\n
Available in dreadnought, concert and parlour body sizes, all models share that classic ‘bluesman on a budget’ theme, looking authentically cool in a satin matt, Whisky Sour finish highlighting the natural grain pattern of the all-mahogany construction and subtle soundhole rosette.

\n
Electro-acoustic fans are also in for a real treat, as all models are available as electro-acoustic guitars, with single cutaway bodies (parlour - full bodied) and an additional Vintage preamp with controls for volume, bass, middle and treble, phase switch, tuner display and low battery indicator.

Fellow drummers, meet your new best friend. The Cymbal Case is equal parts \r\nperformance, protection, comfort and style.

360° PROTECTION
\r\n
RADIUS PIPING

\r\n
All our cases feature a hard-wearing sole and piping made of Hypalon - the \r\nsame industrial rubber used to create inflatable military rafts. This means the \r\nM80 cymbal pack won't wear through around the edges as most cymbal bags do.

\r\n
LUXURIOUS DIVIDERS

\r\n
Inside the Cymbal Case, 5 discrete, padded slots keep your cymbals protected \r\non the go. The high dividers cover each cymbal right up to the rim.

\r\n
SMART STORAGE
\r\n
CLIP/TUCK SHOULDER STRAPS

\r\n
A fully loaded cymbal case can get way too heavy. In the design process, we \r\ndiscovered that our backpack system with chest clip did wonders to distribute \r\nthe weight of all those cymbals. Unclip the shoulder strap to quickly stash them \r\nwhen you want them out of the way. Dedicated pockets for hi-hats (up to 15\") and \r\nsplash cymbals (up to 10\") keep those smaller cymbals safely separated.

BUILT TO TOUR

RIVETED HANDLE & INDUSTRIAL RUBBER SOLE

\r\n
Rock solid, industrial webbing handles come standard on MONO cases. Bar-tack \r\nstitching and steel rivets reinforce for strength, while high grade webbing \r\nprovides a super comfortable grip.

All M80 cases feature a hard-wearing sole and piping made of Hypalon - the \r\nsame industrial rubber used to create inflatable military rafts. This sole \r\nsimply does not wear out.
